## About

I am Natasa and I am a **Computational Biologist \| Bioinformatic Scientist**, working at [Institute of Applied Biosciences](https://www.inab.certh.gr/) (INAB) situated within the [Centre for Research & Technology, Hellas](https://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx) (CERTH).

I received my **B.Sc.** in **Biochemistry and Biotechnology** from the University of Thessaly where i completed my thesis entitle “Study of genetic variations in patients with haematological malignancies” in collaboration with INAB. Subsequently, i obtained a **M.Sc.** in **Translational Research in Biomedicine** from the Democritus University of Thrace. During my master’s thesis titled ‘Characterization of *TP53* gene mutations in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,’ i became interested in **Bioinformatics** and **Computational Biology**.

Currently, my main focus is on ***analyzing** and **visualizing*** Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, aiming to extract meaningful biological insights. I am also experienced in creating interactive **web applications** and **websites**, making data exploration and visualization more accessible and user-friendly for researchers.

You can explore some of my work in my [Visual Portfolio](https://natanast.github.io/qmd/visual_portfolio.html).
