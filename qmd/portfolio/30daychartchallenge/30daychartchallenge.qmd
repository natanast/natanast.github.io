# 30DayChartChallenge

### About this project

-   The **#30DayChartChallenge** is an annual data visualization event that encourages participants to create one chart per day throughout April, following daily prompts and themes.

-   This project showcases my visual journey through the challenge, where I experimented with diverse datasets, visualization styles, and storytelling approaches.

### Who was involved

This was an individual project, created as part of my personal exploration of data visualization and creative coding in R.

### Tools used

-   **ggplot2**, **ggtext**, and **patchwork** for building and styling plots
